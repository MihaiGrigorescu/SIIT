			<h1>Hello</h1>
			<p> I'm Mihai. I don't ususaly like to do home but I'd figure I'll give this one a try.</p>
			<div class = "desc">
			<p> There's not much to say about me, I'm a pretty chill guy who doesn't like to stress  or work too much, so if there is an easy path to solve a problem you can be sure that I found it, or I'm searching for it.
			Despite my laziness I like sports, I'm playing football, basket or I go out for a run at least twice a week. Given the pandemic I had to accomodate and workout from home which is pretty boring compared to the gym.
			Other hobbies of mine include:
				<ul>
					<li>Watching movies</li>
					<li>Reading (mostly subtitles)</li>
					<li>Talking politics and getting mad about it</li>
					<li>I'll put cooking here also. I make some mean scrambled eggs</li>
				</ul>
			That's about it! Thank you for stopping by.

			Here's list of some of my favourite random things:
